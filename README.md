## How To Contribute
If you have an idea which will **dramatically** change the direction of the project or the effect is long-term, you could `fork` the project,
`put` the idea in this readme and `send` out a pull request. (Why? Checkout [RDD](http://tom.preston-werner.com/2010/08/23/readme-driven-development.html))

If you have more specific suggestion or features want to implement,
then you can put them in file **CHANGELOG.md** under an existent version or create a new version if you think make sense,
and follow the same step like above (fork, change, send pull request). Here we may follow the concept: `Changelog for future = todo list`.

##History

This project was started for [nodeknockout](http://nodeknockout.com/) - a nodejs coding contest.
You can go to the [team page](http://nodeknockout.com/teams/fewtter) for more about the project history.
After the contest, [Eric](https://github.com/ericfong) gave this new name **Basestar** - [a starship in Battlestar Galactica](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cylon_Basestar).
