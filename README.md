##Update

I changed [this project](http://github.com/nko/fewtter) into public on github.
Feel free to fork.
I'll **continue developing** this project, but I need to find another UI library first, UKI dosen't actually meet my requirement.

suggestions and ideas are always welcome, even you have a good name for this project.

###About
The original idea is to create a filter app for twitter, so the name comes from "filter+twitter".
But finally, I decide to create a in-browser **Node online development environment** for nodejs, maybe **"Node"** would be a better name ;) Anyway, here's the features:

###Features plan to implement in the 48hr contest:

- Code editor with tabbed window support
- Project browser
- Code navigator
- Create new project from git repository
- Control script (run/stop) in the ide
- Console window for output
- Simple profiling info

###Features will be implemented if there's enough time:
- diff
- http monitor
- git commit history
- more git operations (commit, push, pull)

###More after the contest:
- debugging (breakpoint, inspector)
- envjs
- vim or emac key-bindings

As it need to modify the local filesystem, the project will be deployed on Joyent at **[fewtter.no.de](http://fewtter.no.de)**
. It's my first time to work with solaris, wish me good luck :)

In-browser ide for node

What a pity, I found a bug **after the contest**, but feel free to test it as a proof of concept.
